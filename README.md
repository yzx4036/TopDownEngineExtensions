## TopDown Engine Extensions

This repository contains community-created extensions for the TopDown Engine, More Mountains' bestselling top down games solution, [available on the Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/topdown-engine-89636?aid=1011lKhG). These extensions can be anything, from an alternate take on an existing Character Ability, to brand new ones, or new ways to use the engine.

- **AdvancedCharacterGridMovement**, _by [JCPhlux](https://github.com/jcphlux)_ : Inhanced version of CharacterGridMovement that allows for more control over the movement of the character. Single script that works for both 2D and 3D.
  Options include:

  - Diagonal Movement: When true allows for diagonal movement.

    _Ignore Cardinal obstacles is still a WIP for 3D movement but works for 2D movement._
  - Ignore Cardinal obstacle Movement State: Configurable movement state to set the movement state to when moving through a cardinal direction obstacle. _ex. set to "Jumping" to set the state to "Jumping" when moving through a cardinal direction obstacle._

## Why aren't these in the engine directly?

Because they weren't created by Renaud, the creator of the TopDown Engine, because I want to keep the Engine simple to use and just pouring features into it (as cool as they may be) wouldn't be such a great idea, and because the Engine is meant to be extended upon, and these extensions are great examples of that.

## Do I need to pay something? Give credit?

No you don't, it's all free to use. Feel free to give credit to their creators though (they'll mention that in the class' comments if they want to).

## Are more extensions coming? Can I contribute?

Absolutely, contributions are always welcome. If you want to contribute, drop me a line using [the form on this page](https://topdown-engine.moremountains.com/topdown-engine-contact), or create a pull request on this very repository.

## Hey this extension is not working!

You'd need to contact the creator of the extension if they've put their contact info in the class somewhere. If not, not much I can do, I won't provide support for these.
